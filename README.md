Capture the Ether is a popular CTF designed to teach people about smart contract security on the Ethereum blockchain. In this game, participants are tasked with finding vulnerabilities and exploiting them in Ethereum smart contracts to progress through various levels.

The game presents a series of challenges, each involving a smart contract with a specific vulnerability to be discovered and exploited. Participants use their knowledge of Ethereum, Solidity, and smart contract security best practices to identify and exploit these vulnerabilities.

By participating in Capture the Ether, players gain hands-on experience in identifying common security issues such as reentrancy, integer overflow, and logic flaws. They also learn how to write secure smart contracts by understanding how vulnerabilities can be mitigated or avoided.
